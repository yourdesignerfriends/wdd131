                    <p>My name is Analina, I was born in Venezuela, a beautiful country near the Caribbean coast of South America. When I lived in Venezuela I loved going to the beach to enjoy the sun and spend time with my family. Right now I am living in Washington State, it is a very beautiful place and I saw snow for the first time. There are beautiful beaches here too, but they are too cold to swim. Two years ago I was sealed in the temple to the love of my life. I like to ride my bike and climb mountains with my husband. I heard a song at an elementary school where I work where the children were reciting that they were thankful for the USA, I share that feeling too, I always pray that God holds the USA and all the nations of the world in His hands.</p>

                    <p>Caracas, the vibrant capital of Venezuela, is a place of natural and cultural beauty, surrounded by the majestic El Ávila National Park. Known for its hospitality, street art, and delicious cuisine, it is also the birthplace of Simón Bolívar, "El Libertador," who liberated six countries in South America: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, and Bolivia. Located in the northern part of South America, Caracas holds a special place in history and culture. Additionally, colorful macaws (guacamayas) often grace the city's skies, adding a touch of tropical charm to this already captivating metropolis.</p>
